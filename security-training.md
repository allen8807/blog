* What is Software Security?

  * Software security focuses on protecting information and resources made accessible by applications running on computer systems.软件安全是保护计算机应用可访问的信息和资源
  * Software security is often confused with network security. Network security focuses on the protection of an organization’s IT infrastructure—the servers and related equipment that control the flow of data between networked systems.网络安全是保护一个组织的IT基础设施，控制网络系统的数据流
  * Network security controls are typically insufficient to mitigate software security risks.网络安全控制通常不足以减轻软件安全风险
  * Software security attacks often occur at higher layers of operation, not visible to network security controls.

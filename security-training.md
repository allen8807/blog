* What is Software Security?
  * Software security focuses on protecting information and resources made accessible by applications running on computer systems.软件安全是保护计算机应用可访问的信息和资源
  * Software security is often confused with network security. Network security focuses on the protection of an organization’s IT infrastructure—the servers and related equipment that control the flow of data between networked systems.网络安全是保护一个组织的IT基础设施，控制网络系统的数据流
  * Network security controls are typically insufficient to mitigate software security risks.网络安全控制通常不足以减轻软件安全风险
  * Software security attacks often occur at higher layers of operation, not visible to network security controls.软件安全攻击通常发生在较高层操作，对网络安全控制不可见。


* The Security Imperative
  * Key reasons why organizations must develop and deploy secure software include:
    * High business costs of security breaches
    * Compliance and legal implications of security breaches
    * Customer expectations of security
    * An increasing threat landscape


* The Business Costs of Software Security Breaches
  * Software security breaches expose organizations to various risks that result in the following direct and indirect costs:直接间接成本
    * Downtime and other operational losses if an application is hacked 停机时间和其他操作成本
    * Financial claims and settlements 财务索赔和结算
    * Compliance fines and penalties 合规罚款和处罚
    * Loss of investor and customer confidence 失去投资人和客户信心
    * Lost sales 销售额损失
    * Damage to reputation 声誉受损
  * McAfee estimates the global annual cost of cybercrime at over $400 billion dollars.\*
  * \*Source: Net Losses: Estimating the Global Cost of Cybercrime, June 2014, McAfee, Intel Security
    

* Compliance and Legal Implications 合规和法律意义
  * Federal and state regulations mandate software security and require protection of sensitive customer data. 法规要求保护用户敏感数据
  * Even if an organization is not required by local regulations to develop secure software, they might still need to do so to conduct business in other states.就算本地没有要求，要在其他地方开展业务也会有要求
  * It is difficult, if not impossible, to ignore software security without incurring significant fines or loss of business. 重大罚款和业务损失
  
  
* Customers Expect Secure Solutions 用户期望安全解决方案
  * Regulatory and legislative measures and the media have increased business awareness of the need for secure software and services. 监管，法规媒体提高了安全需求意识
  * Failure to develop and deliver secure software and services could damage your organization’s reputation, and drive business to your competitors. 失败的安全开发会影响声誉
  
  
* An Increasing Threat Landscape 增长的威胁环境
  * In the past, hackers were motivated to attack systems and software to gain notoriety. Today, the number of attacks is increasing, and attackers are motivated by financial gains, political agendas, and corporate and international espionage.黑客以前是为了名声，现在是为了财，政以及作为间谍
  * Specialized hacking techniques are publicly documented and well understood by many. In addition, automated attack tools are freely available and accessible.专业的黑客技术已经被公开，自动黑客工具也很容易免费得到
  * This translates to a higher probability of being hacked, as well as higher expected costs for recovering from cyber attacks.这些意味着攻击可能性的提高和恢复成本的提高
  
  
* Module Summary
  * In this module, you learned how software security differs from network security. 软件安全和网络安全的区别
  * You also learned the key reasons why organizations must develop secure software, including high business costs of security breaches, compliance and legal implications of security breaches, customer expectations of security, and a changing threat landscape. 为什么进行安全开发的关键原因


* Module Overview
  * This module introduces models, standards, and guidelines that you can use to improve the security posture of your applications. These resources provide a roadmap to follow to design security into your applications. You don't need to become a security expert to use them.


* Module Objectives
  * After completing this module, you will be able to:
    * Identify how security activities overlay the software development process.知道安全活动如何覆盖软件开发过程。
